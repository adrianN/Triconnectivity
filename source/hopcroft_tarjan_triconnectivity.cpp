/*
 * Finding separation pairs as described in "Dividing a graph into triconnected components"
 *
 * It finds a separation pair of G if G is not triconnected.
 *
 * Let (a,b) be a pair of vertices in the biconnected multigraph G. Suppose the edges of G
 * are divided into equivalence classes E1..En such that two edges are in the same class
 * iff there is a path that contains both and doesn't contain a or b, except as an endpoint.
 * If there are at least two Ei, then {a,b} is a separation pair of G, unless
 * 	i) 	there are exactly two separation classes and one class consists of a single edge (this
 * 		only happens if the edge between (a,b) is a class by itself or G is not biconnected
 * 		and a or b is an articulation point)
 * 	ii) there are exactly three classes, each consisting of a single edge. (TODO think of an
 * 		example for this one that isn't x - a - b - y)
 *
 * Note that the definition of separation pair makes any pair of vertices a - b with a multiple
 * edge between them a separation pair, if there is at least one more edge in the graph.
 *
 * The algorithm is based on the idea of finding cycles in biconnected graphs and the removing
 * them to obtain a number of segments
 *
 * Let G be a biconnected multigraph and let c be a cycle in G. Let S1...Sn be the connected
 * components of G-c. S1 .. Sn and c partition the edges of G. Let {a,b} be a separation pair of
 * G such that (a,b) is not a multiple edge. Then the following things hold
 *
 * i) Either a,b is contained on c, or (a,b) is contained in _one_ segment
 *
 * Let, for the sake of contradiction, (a,b) be in segments S1, S2. Since G is biconnected
 * 		S1 and S2 are connected by two paths, both on c. For (a,b) to be a separation pair it must
 * 		induce at least two equivalence classes on the edges. All the edges in S1 are in one
 * 		equivalence class, say E1, since S1 is biconnected and a can't be an articulation point. The same
 * 		holds for S2. Clearly all other segments are also in E1 or E2, as they are connected
 * 		to S1, respectively S2, via >=2 paths, at least one of which doesn't contain a or b. But since
 * 		S1 and S2 are themselves connected to c by at least two edges each, E_1 = E_2 and (a,b)
 * 		is not a separation pair.
 *
 * ii) Suppose a and b both lie on c. Let p,q be the two paths on c that connect a with b. Then either
 *
 * 	a) 	Some segment Si with at least two edges has only a and b in common with c, and some
 * 		vertex v does not lie in Si (type 1 pair)
 * 	b) 	no segment contains a vertex v != a,b in p and a vertex w != a,b on q and p and q each contain a
 * 		vertex besides a and b (type 2 pair)
 *
 *		Suppose neither a) nor b) hold.
 *		If a) does not hold every segment has more nodes in common with c or there is no vertex that
 *		doesn't lie in Si. If there is no vertex outside of Si, (a,b) is not a separation pair
 *
 *
 * The idea of the algorithm is to find cycles c with their corresponding segments and check
 * (recursively) for the above conditions. Since both enumerating all cycles and checking all
 * pairs on the cycles in too expensive, something clever has to be done.
 *
 * We can use a DFS to find the cycles, but to simulate the recursive nature of the algorithm, we
 * need that
 *  a) the first DFS path is a cycle
 *  b) any consecutive path doesn't contain edges that lie on previous cycles and can be
 *  	completed to a cycle by adding part of exactly one old path (this way the cycle lies within
 *  	one segment.
 *
 * Since the DFS order depends on the order in the adjacency lists, we run a preliminary computation
 * that reorders the lists and builds an acceptable adjacency structure. This is done in step_one()
 *
 * We then proceed to identify the paths in the graph (step_two()) and finally, in another DFS, check
 * for separation pairs.

     * Suppose (a,b) satisfies 2. Let S be the subtree of r - the subtree of b. All nodes in S are in one separation class, say E_1. Since b is a first descendant of r (ii), it gets finished first during
     * the pathfinder dfs and has the highest number, hence S = {x| r<= x < b}. Let b_1,...,b_n be the sons of b. By the ordering in the acceptable adjacency structure, there is an index
     * i_0 s.t. i < i_0 implies lowpoint_one[b_i] < a and i>=i_0 implies lowpoint_one[b_i] >= a. By (iv) every frond which starts in S ends in S union a, since a<=y and a->r there are no nodes
     * y outside of S union a. (v) makes sure that fronds that reach into S from below b don't connect E_1 with nodes above a, that is, they start in S cup b cup D(b_i), i>=i_0. Thus E_1 contains
     * at least all edges ending in S and at most all edges ending in S and D(b_i) i>=i_0 (if type (v) fronds exist). But since a is not the root of the tree, there must be some more nodes
