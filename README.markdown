Triconnectivity
===============

This is an implementation of the algorithms of [Hopcroft and Tarjan](http://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/6037) and [Schmidt](http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6187) using [LEDA](http://algorithmic-solutions.com/), the Library of Efficient Datatypes and Algorithms.

The documentation in the code is somewhat lacking and the code is riddled with debug stuff, but you can read my [master's thesis](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~aneumann/masterarbeit.pdf) for a (hopefully) clean and understandable presentation.
